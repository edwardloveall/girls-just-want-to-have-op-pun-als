My friend [Gabe](https://github.com/gabebw) wrote a [blog post](http://gabebw.com/blog/2015/10/24/how-to-learn-a-new-programming-language) about learning a new programming language. The project creates (bad) puns by replacing words in phrases with a word that rhymes e.x. `off to a good heart (pun of off to a good start)`. This is a swift implimentation of that.

If you want to run this, clone the repo, build the repo (there are no dependencies), get a [phrase file](https://github.com/drapergeek/elixirls_just_want_to_have_puns/tree/master/phrases), and run the app:

```shell
path/to/puns heart path/to/phrase-file.txt
```

Critique welcome
